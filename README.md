# Applying Inter-rater Reliability and Agreement in Grounded Theory Studies in Software Engineering

This work presents a process for systematically applying Inter-rater Reliability (IRR) and Inter-rater Agreement (IRA) in Gorunded Theory (GT) studies. 

To that end, we previously conducted a systematic literature review on IRR/IRA in GT studies in the field of software engineering, and subsequently applied the process in a GT study in the domain of *EdgeOps* in industry.
