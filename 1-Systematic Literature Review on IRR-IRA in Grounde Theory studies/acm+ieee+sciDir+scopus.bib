   abstract = {This article presents a study in which we explored the effect of a social robot on the explanatory behavior of children (aged 6–10) while working on an inquiry learning task. In a comparative experiment, we offered children either a baseline Computer Aided Learning (CAL) system or the same CAL system that was supplemented with a social robot to verbally explain their thoughts to. Results indicate that when children made observations in an inquiry learning context, the robot was better able to trigger elaborate explanatory behavior. First, this is shown by a longer duration of explanatory utterances by children who worked with the robot compared to the baseline CAL system. Second, a content analysis of the explanations indicated that children who worked with the robot included more relevant utterances about the task in their explanation. Third, the content analysis shows that children made more logical associations between relevant facets in their explanations when they explained to a robot compared to a baseline CAL system. These results show that social robots that are used as extensions to CAL systems may be beneficial for triggering explanatory behavior in children, which is associated with deeper learning.},

   abstract = {Over the past two years the Ubicomp vision of ambient voice assistants, in the form of smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home, has been integrated into tens of millions of homes. However, the use of these systems over time in the home has not been studied in depth. We set out to understand exactly what users are doing with these devices over time through analyzing voice history logs of 65,499 interactions with existing Google Home devices from 88 diverse homes over an average of 110 days. We found that specific types of commands were made more often at particular times of day and that commands in some domains increased in length over time as participants tried out new ways to interact with their devices, yet exploration of new topics was low. Four distinct user groups also emerged based on using the device more or less during the day vs. in the evening or using particular categories. We conclude by comparing smart speaker use to a similar study of smartphone use and offer implications for the design of new smart speaker assistants and skills, highlighting specific areas where both manufacturers and skill providers can focus in this domain.},

   abstract = {Live streaming is an emergent social medium that allows remote interaction between the streamer and an audience of any size. Major live-streaming platforms in some Asian countries have a digital gift-giving feature that allows viewers to directly reward streamers during live sessions. Streamers can later exchange the digital gifts they have received for money, and this monetary incentive appears likely to influence how they interact with their viewers and generate live-streaming content. However, the precise nature and mechanisms of such impact have not previously been explored. Therefore, this qualitative study with 13 streamer participants examines how digital gifting influences streamers' motivations and the nature of both the content that they generate and their social interactions with their audiences. It reports that the digital-gifting function serves as a major incentive for active streaming, but may also disincentivize some streamers from continuing to contribute, for reasons that will be explored. Moreover, the participants devised strategies for both content generation and social interaction with the specific objective of earning gifts from viewers: practices that, in some cases, appeared to limit the quality of their live-streaming content. It was also noted that the streamers tended to have constrained social relationships with their viewers, in part because such relationships were seen as unequal or one-sided due to gift-giving behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of design considerations for the incorporation of gift-giving features into live-streaming platforms, and additional recommendations for future research and the design of such platforms.},

   abstract = {Effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.},

AD caregivers disproportionately experience numerous health problems and are often isolated with little support. An active lifestyle can help prevent and mitigate physical and psychological health concerns amongst AD caregivers. Research has demonstrated how pervasive exergames can encourage physical activity (PA) in the general population, yet little work has explored how these tools can address the significant PA barriers that AD caregivers face. To identify opportunities for design, we conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 14 informal caregivers of family members with AD.

These movements have the potential to counteract bias and enable social justice, but are enacted in a forum rife with identity and boundary management concerns. To understand this type of movement, we present a qualitative study of #ILookLikeAnEngineer, a hashtag created to challenge engineering stereotypes. We interviewed 32 people, including participants and non-participants of the movement, about their experiences with the hashtag. We found that personally identifiable participation promoted feelings of empowerment and strengthened connections within the marginalized community. At the same time, the personal and professional identity focus raised ambiguity about the boundaries of the collective and the movement's ability to change stereotypes. We discuss implications for online collective action and the use of social media for addressing stereotypes.},

   abstract = {Robots are expected to enter the everyday lives of people to entertain, educate, or support them. It is therefore important that people can intuitively understand the behavior of robots. Oftentimes, the behavior of people is used as a model because of its familiarity. However, it is as yet unclear what the best approach is to design interaction behaviors for non-humanoid robots. In this article, we explore two different approaches toward designing behavior for a service robot. The first concerns the commonly used approach of copying human behavior as closely as possible to the robot (human-translated). The second approach was inspired by product design methods. The design of the robot's behavior was optimized for the robot's interaction capabilities and hardware modalities (robot-optimized). To evaluate people's responses to the two behavior sets for a tour guide robot, an online video study (N = 204) and a two-day in-the-wild study (N &gt; 600) were performed. Results showed that participants responded slightly more positive to robot-optimized behavior and paid attention to robot-optimized behavior for longer. However, participants remembered more details when the robot showed human-translated behavior. Together, the studies show that it is sometimes better for non-humanoid robots to have robot-optimized behaviors rather than human-translated behaviors.},

   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly influential to human society, yet the primary advancements and applications of ML are driven by research in only a few computational disciplines. Even applications that affect or analyze human behaviors and social structures are often developed with limited input from experts outside of computational fields. Social scientists—experts trained to examine and explain the complexity of human behavior and interactions in the world—have considerable expertise to contribute to the development of ML applications for human-generated data, and their analytic practices could benefit from more human-centered ML methods. Although a few researchers have highlighted some gaps between ML and social sciences [51, 57, 70], most discussions only focus on quantitative methods. Yet many social science disciplines rely heavily on qualitative methods to distill patterns that are challenging to discover through quantitative data. One common analysis method for qualitative data is qualitative coding. In this article, we highlight three challenges of applying ML to qualitative coding. Additionally, we utilize our experience of designing a visual analytics tool for collaborative qualitative coding to demonstrate the potential in using ML to support qualitative coding by shifting the focus to identifying ambiguity. We illustrate dimensions of ambiguity and discuss the relationship between disagreement and ambiguity. Finally, we propose three research directions to ground ML applications for social science as part of the progression toward human-centered machine learning.},

The crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. In this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups—journalism students and Upwork workers—as well as 2 expert groups—journalists and scientists—on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use—differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content.},

Research in the area of algorithmic fairness tends to be rooted in questions of distribution that can be subject to precise formalism and technical implementation. We seek to expand this conversation to include the experiences of people subject to algorithmic classification and decision-making. By examining tweets about the "Twitter algorithm" we consider the wide range of concerns and desires Twitter users express. We find a concern with fairness (narrowly construed) is present, particularly in the ways users complain that the platform enacts a political bias against conservatives. However, we find another important category of concern, evident in attempts to exert control over the algorithm. Twitter users who seek control do so for a variety of reasons, many well justified. We argue for the need for better and clearer definitions of what constitutes legitimate and illegitimate control over algorithmic processes and to consider support for users who wish to enact their own collective choices.},

Previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators? subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. We propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. We analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. Our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. Arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. This imposition is largely naturalized. Assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. This paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society.},

   abstract = {What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: "should I calculate IRR?" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

   abstract = {Objectives
This study explores the interaction between online social networking experiences and wellbeing in 12 young people accessing mental health services.
Methods
Data from semi-structured interviews was analysed using Grounded Theory methodology.
Results
“Threats and judgement” and “connection and support” were experienced by adolescents, facilitated by having continuous access to a vast social network. These experiences influenced adolescents' psychological wellbeing, mediated by their responses to threat and judgement and maintaining “safe sharing” with their network. Social network use was conceived as a gamble of balancing its potentially positive and negative impact in a culture in which social network use appears to be unavoidable.
Conclusions
The findings indicate the importance of routine assessment and formulation of social networking use in understanding adolescents' psychological distress. Furthermore, a range of opportunities exist for clinicians to utilise the anonymity and peer support that social networks offer to broaden the range of mental health services offered to young people.},

However, iteration is difficult to coach because we do not understand the underlying metacognitive knowledge required for effective iteration. We developed the Design Risks Framework, which helps researchers to identify the knowledge underlying three metacognitive processes that control iteration: focusing attention on key areas of the project, identifying project risks, and choosing iterative strategies to mitigate risks. We tested the framework over a 6-week period with 5 novice design teams and found that novices seemed to lack metacognitive knowledge of 49 criteria for identifying project risks. By using this framework to diagnose knowledge gaps and design coaching interventions, educators and managers can improve how novice designers iterate in design projects.},

   abstract = {The outcome of the UK's referendum on whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union (so-called Brexit) came as a jolt to many across Europe. In this paper, we use causal mapping from soft OR to analyse longitudinal data from nine televised Brexit debates spread across the 4 weeks leading up to the referendum. We analyse these causal maps to build one view on why Brexit happened. The maps are analysed for the breadth, depth and consistency of arguments in the debate and, broadly, finds that the Leave campaign focused more consistently on a smaller set of campaign themes, contributed more detail to those themes, and focused on their own core issues rather than being diverted onto Remain strongholds. In contrast, Remain shared more information but across a broader range of themes (meaning they were less consistent), and followed Leave into themes that were clearly not their core battleground. The novelties for soft OR in this paper include: the difficulties of building and validating causal maps from secondary data; new techniques for analysing a group of causal maps to uncover the properties of arguments that spread longitudinally through a campaign; a methodology for a teaching case using publicly availability data; linking the paper, philosophically, to critical realism given the unique dataset. Finally, we identify differences in the Leave and Remain debate campaigns to offer one answer to the question ‘Why did Brexit happen?’},

   abstract = {The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is very high amongmidwives resulting in sickness absenteeism, functional limitation and staff shortages. There are several contributory risk factors having impact on the development of MSDs. This study aimed to (1) explore midwives' experiences and views about work-related MSDs and contributing risk factors, and (2) analyse working postures for musculoskeletal injury risks. A mixed method approach was used with interviews/focus group (n = 15/7) and observations (n = 22) of specific tasks (during birth and after birth) using the posture analysis observational method (Rapid Entire Body Assessment, REBA). The participants were midwives who had an active role in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Services (NHS). It was found that MSDs were often attributed to the physical (working in awkward positions), organisational (longer shift hours, fewer staff, increased work load), psychosocial (defensive practice, higher demand) challenges of midwifery. All postures had very high to medium REBA risk levels with action categories indicating that action or further assessment is definitely necessary to reduce MSDs. This research provides a holistic approach by analysing risk factors and interactions in the work context to inform the development of risk management strategies. Midwifery working conditions have a big impact on developing musculoskeletal symptoms. Management of such symptoms will improve staff wellbeing, mother and baby safety, individuals' life trajectories and staff shortages.},

To analyze this foraging behavior while debugging, we utilize an Information Foraging Theory perspective. Information Foraging Theory models the human (predator) behavior to forage for specific information (prey) in the webpages or programming IDEs (patches) by following the information features (cues) in the environment. We qualitatively studied the debugging behavior of 16 web-active end users. Our results show that end-user programmers spend substantial amounts (73%) of their time just foraging. Further, our study reveals new cue types and foraging strategies framed in terms of Information Foraging Theory, and it uncovers which of these helped end-user programmers succeed in their debugging efforts.},

   abstract = {Context
Requirements engineering in agile software development is a relatively recent software engineering topic and it is not completely explored and understood. The understanding of how this process works on agile world needs a deeper analysis.
Objective
The goal of this paper is to map the subject area of requirements engineering in agile context to identify the main topics that have been researched and to identify gaps to develop future researches. It is also intended to identify the obstacles that practitioners face when using agile requirements engineering.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted and as a result 2171 papers were initially identified and further narrowed to 104 by applying exclusion criteria and analysis.
Conclusion
After completing the classification and the analysis of the selected studies it was possible to identify 15 areas (13 based on SWEBOK) where researches were developed. Five of such areas points to the need of future researches, among them are requirements elicitation, change management, measuring requirements, software requirements tools and comparative studies between traditional and agile requirements. In this research, some obstacles that practitioners face dealing with requirements engineering in agile context were also identified. They are related to environment, people and resources.},

   abstract = {Insomnia and depression is a common and debilitating comorbidity, and treatment is usually given mainly for depression. Guided Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (ICBT-i) was, in a recent study on which this report is based, found superior to a treatment for depression (ICBT-d) for this patient group, but many patients did not reach remission.
Aims
To identify facilitating and hindering factors for patients in ICBT-i and ICBT-d and formulate hypotheses for future research.
Method
Qualitative telephone interviews at the time of the 6-month follow-up. Thirty-five interviews were done and analyzed with a grounded theory approach. Based on the qualitative results, an iterative method-triangulation including quantitative and semi-qualitative was performed.
Results
The interviews were coded into 738 sentences, condensed into 47 categories and finally 11 themes. Four areas were investigated further with method triangulation: Opinions about treatment, adherence, hindering symptoms and acceptance. Patients in ICBT-i were more positive regarding the treatment than patients in ICBT-d. Using treatment components was positively associated with outcome in both groups. Symptoms of insomnia, depression and other comorbidities were perceived as more hindering for ICBT-d than for ICBT-i. Acceptance of diagnose-related problems as well as negative emotions and cognitions was positively associated with outcome for ICBT-i.
Proposed future research hypotheses
1) A combination of CBT for insomnia and CBT for depression is more effective than only one of the treatments. 2) Additional therapist support increases outcomes for patients with more comorbidities. 3) Acceptance is a mechanism of change in CBT-i.},

   abstract = {Software test process improvement (STPI) approaches are frameworks that guide software development organizations to improve their software testing process. We have identified existing STPI approaches and their characteristics (such as completeness of development, availability of information and assessment instruments, and domain limitations of the approaches) using a systematic literature review (SLR). Furthermore, two selected approaches (TPI NEXT and TMMi) are evaluated with respect to their content and assessment results in industry. As a result of this study, we have identified 18 STPI approaches and their characteristics. A detailed comparison of the content of TPI NEXT and TMMi is done. We found that many of the STPI approaches do not provide sufficient information or the approaches do not include assessment instruments. This makes it difficult to apply many approaches in industry. Greater similarities were found between TPI NEXT and TMMi and fewer differences. We conclude that numerous STPI approaches are available but not all are generally applicable for industry. One major difference between available approaches is their model representation. Even though the applied approaches generally show strong similarities, differences in the assessment results arise due to their different model representations.},

   abstract = {As modern society becomes more reliant on technology, its use within the vehicle is becoming a concern for road safety due to both portable and built-in devices offering sources of distraction. While the effects of distracting technologies are well documented, little is known about the causal factors that lead to the drivers' engagement with technological devices. The relevance of the sociotechnical system within which the behaviour occurs requires further research. This paper presents two experiments, the first aims to assess the drivers self-reported decision to engage with technological tasks while driving and their reasoning for doing so with respect to the wider sociotechnical system. This utilised a semi-structured interview method, conducted with 30 drivers to initiate a discussion on their likelihood of engaging with 22 different tasks across 7 different road types. Inductive thematic analysis provided a hierarchical thematic framework that detailed the self-reported causal factors that influence the drivers’ use of technology whilst driving. The second experiment assessed the relevance of the hierarchical framework to a model of distraction that was established from within the literature on the drivers use of distracting technologies while driving. The findings provide validation for some relationships studied in the literature, as well as providing insights into relationships that require further study. The role of the sociotechnical system in the engagement of distractions while driving is highlighted, with the causal factors reported by drivers suggesting the importance of considering the wider system within which the behaviour is occurring and how it may be creating the conditions for distraction to occur. This supports previous claims made within the literature based model. Recommendations are proposed that encourage a movement away from individual focused countermeasures towards systemic actors.},

However, the literature is fragmented and lacks an overarching framework to integrate findings and systematically guide research. Moreover, researchers and practitioners continue to question the value of BI systems. This study reviews and synthesizes empirical Information System (IS) studies to learn what we know, how well we know, and what we need to know about the processes of organizations obtaining business value from BI systems. The study aims to identify which parts of the BI business value process have been studied and are still most in need of research, and to propose specific research questions for the future. The findings show that organizations appear to obtain value from BI systems according to the process suggested by Soh and Markus (1995), as a chain of necessary conditions from BI investments to BI assets to BI impacts to organizational performance; however, researchers have not sufficiently studied the probabilistic processes that link the necessary conditions together. Moreover, the research has not sufficiently covered all relevant levels of analysis, nor examined how the levels link up. Overall, the paper identified many opportunities for researchers to provide a more complete picture of how organizations can and do obtain value from BI.},

However, there has been much less discussion on factors influencing the continued use of government websites. This study identifies and tests a theoretical model that predicts consumers’ intentions to continue using government portals, using a mixed methods approach based on Grounded Theory. To construct a theoretical framework of public interest in continued use of government information portals, we interviewed 56 respondents and coded the interview data. Next, we tested the resulting model using data collected from a questionnaire-based survey of 354 users. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results indicate that continued use is influenced by psychological perception, user characteristics, service parameters of the government portals and the government’s idea. Of these, psychological perception was found to have the strongest effect. These findings enrich the theoretical system of e-government public adoption of intention and have important practical significance for the development of Chinese government portals.},

Inner source software development (ISSD) has been viewed as an alternative approach in which organisations adopt open source software development (OSSD) practices and exploit its benefits internally.
Objective
In this paper, we aim to provide an extensive review of current research on ISSD and to establish a research agenda on this domain.
Method
The review is primarily performed using a systematic literature review protocol.
Results
We identified, critically evaluated and integrated the findings of 37 primary studies, describing 25 empirical research papers, 10 frameworks/methods, models and tools to support the implementation of inner source, as well as a set of benefits and challenges associated with ISSD.
Conclusion
This study presents four main contributions. First, the study provides an in-depth review of ISSD to date, i.e. the evolution of research across inner source, contributions of existing research developments, and theories, models and frameworks used to study inner source. Second, our review applies the OSSD approach framework as the lens to analyse ISSD. Third, the review updates the key challenges associated with ISSD from a management perspective. The final contribution is the establishment of a research agenda to advance knowledge on ISSD.},

   abstract = {Effective communication during nurse handoffs is instrumental in ensuring safe and quality patient care. Much of the prior research on nurse handoffs has utilized retrospective methods such as interviews, surveys and questionnaires. While extremely useful, an in-depth understanding of the structure and content of conversations, and the inherent relationships within the content is paramount to designing effective nurse handoff interventions. In this paper, we present a methodological framework—Sequential Conversational Analysis (SCA)—a mixed-method approach that integrates qualitative conversational analysis with quantitative sequential pattern analysis. We describe the SCA approach and provide a detailed example as a proof of concept of its use for the analysis of nurse handoff communication in a medical intensive care unit. This novel approach allows us to characterize the conversational structure, clinical content, disruptions in the conversation, and the inherently phasic nature of nurse handoff communication. The characterization of communication patterns highlights the relationships underlying the verbal content of nurse handoffs with specific emphasis on: the interactive nature of conversation, relevance of role-based (incoming, outgoing) communication requirements, clinical content focus on critical patient-related events, and discussion of pending patient management tasks. We also discuss the applicability of the SCA approach as a method for providing in-depth understanding of the dynamics of communication in other settings and domains.},

   abstract = {Context
The software industry has changed significantly in the 21st century; no longer is it dominated by organizations seeking to sell products directly to customers, instead most multinational organizations nowadays provide services via licensing agreements. These licenses are for a fixed-duration; and hence, the question of their renewal becomes of paramount importance for the selling organization’s revenue.
Objective
Despite its financial impact, the topic of license renewal strategies, processes, tools, and support receives very limited attention in the research literature. Hence, it is believed that an interesting research question is: What is the state of current industrial practice in this essential field?
Method
To initially explore the topic of license renewals, this paper implements the Grounded theory method. To implement the method, semi-structured, cross-sectional, anonymous, selfreported interviews are carried out with 20 professionals from multiple organizations, later the Constant Comparative Method is used to analyse the collected data.
Results
This paper presents a synthesized picture of the current industrial practice of the end-to-end software license renewal process. Alongside, it also identifies a set of challenges and risk factors that impact on renewal decisions of customers, hence on the overall revenue of seller organizations. Finally, using structured brainstorming techniques, this paper identifies 11 future research directions, that can help organizations with the mitigation of the risks in the license renewal process.
Conclusion
It is concluded that lack of effective communication among stakeholders, the absence of customer trust, and scarcity of value generated from purchased licenses are among the primary drivers that influence renewal decisions. Also, there is a need to invest in intelligent automation along with artificial intelligence enabled analytics in order to enhance customer satisfaction.},

However, researchers are not well informed about the shift of PIP research trends with time. In particular, there is a lack of understanding of what constructs have been studied in what contexts. As a result, researchers may design their study without sufficient guidance. This problem can lead to unproductive efforts in advancing PIP research. Therefore, it is important and timely to review prior PIP research to enhance our understanding of how it has evolved. We are particularly interested in understanding the chronological changes in contexts and research constructs studied. We use a chronological stage model of PIP research we develop, a set of contextual variables identified from prior literature, and the four-party PIP model suggested by Conger et al. (2013) as theoretical foundations to conduct a chronological literature review of empirical PIP concern studies. We find several PIP research trends during the last two decades, such as the quantity of PIP research has drastically increased; the variety of contexts and research constructs being studied has increased substantially; and many constructs have been studied only once while only a few have been repeatedly studied. We also find that the focus of PIP research has shifted from general/unspecified contexts to specific ones. We discuss the contributions of the study and recommendations for future research directions. We propose a fifth party as an emergent player in the ecosystem of PIP and call for future research that investigates it.},

Increasingly, software development organizations are adopting global software development (GSD) strategies, mainly because of the significant return on investment they produce. However, there are many challenges associated with GSD, particularly with regards to software process improvement (SPI). SPI can play a significant role in the successful execution of GSD projects.
Objective
The aim of the present study was to identify barriers that can negatively affect SPI initiatives in GSD organizations from both client and vendor perspectives.
Method
A systematic literature review (SLR) and survey questionnaire were used to identify and validate the barriers.
Results
Twenty-two barriers to successful SPI programs were identified. Results illustrate that the barriers identified using SLR and survey approaches have more similarities However, there were significant differences between the ranking of these barriers in the SLR and survey approaches, as indicated by the results of t-tests (for instance, t = 2.28, p = 0.011 < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that there is a moderate positive correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the empirical study (rs (22)= 0.567, p = 0.006).
Conclusions
The identified barriers can assist both client and vendor GSD organizations during initiation of an SPI program. Client-vendor classification was used to provide a broad picture of SPI programs, and their respective barriers. The top-ranked barriers can be used as a guide for GSD organizations prior to the initiation of an SPI program. We believe that the results of this study can be useful in tackling the problems associated with the implementation of SPI, which is vital to the success and progression of GSD organizations.},

   abstract = {Context
Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is a common approach to develop and evolve contemporary software systems. When evolving a system based on components, make-or-buy decisions are frequent, i.e., whether to develop components internally or to acquire them from external sources. In CBSE, several different sourcing options are available: (1) developing software in-house, (2) outsourcing development, (3) buying commercial-off-the-shelf software, and (4) integrating open source software components.
Objective
Unfortunately, there is little available research on how organizations select component sourcing options (CSO) in industry practice. In this work, we seek to contribute empirical evidence to CSO selection.
Method
We conduct a cross-domain survey on CSO selection in industry, implemented as an online questionnaire.
Results
Based on 188 responses, we find that most organizations consider multiple CSOs during software evolution, and that the CSO decisions in industry are dominated by expert judgment. When choosing between candidate components, functional suitability acts as an initial filter, then reliability is the most important quality.
Conclusion
We stress that future solution-oriented work on decision support has to account for the dominance of expert judgment in industry. Moreover, we identify considerable variation in CSO decision processes in industry. Finally, we encourage software development organizations to reflect on their decision processes when choosing whether to make or buy components, and we recommend using our survey for a first benchmarking.},

   abstract = {Though the “maker movement” has become an international phenomenon in recent years it has been mostly embraced by highly educated and wealthy men. As the makerspaces and fabrication labs become a more mainstream method used by schools to motivate students to explore STEM domains, lack of engagement among women and other underrepresented groups is a major concern. Building upon literature from the feminist tradition, the Bots for Tots project explores the affordances of activity framings and structures that tap into learners’ cultural values and alternate mental dispositions to broaden participation and interest in maker activities. In this paper I describe a workshop where 9–10-year-old children were tasked with constructing “dream toys” for 4-year old students in their school. Data collected from interviews, observations, and student-built project suggest that when making is framed as being a set of practices, skills, and technologies to connect with one’s community, young girls are likely to be initially motivated to engage in the maker activity, persist through construction challenges, and to show interest in further exploring making and technology.},

   abstract = {Software engineering research is evolving and papers are increasingly based on empirical data from a multitude of sources, using statistical tests to determine if and to what degree empirical evidence supports their hypotheses. To investigate the practices and trends of statistical analysis in empirical software engineering (ESE), this paper presents a review of a large pool of papers from top-ranked software engineering journals. First, we manually reviewed 161 papers and in the second phase of our method, we conducted a more extensive semi-automatic classification of papers spanning the years 2001–2015 and 5196 papers. Results from both review steps was used to: i) identify and analyse the predominant practices in ESE (e.g., using t-test or ANOVA), as well as relevant trends in usage of specific statistical methods (e.g., nonparametric tests and effect size measures) and, ii) develop a conceptual model for a statistical analysis workflow with suggestions on how to apply different statistical methods as well as guidelines to avoid pitfalls. Lastly, we confirm existing claims that current ESE practices lack a standard to report practical significance of results. We illustrate how practical significance can be discussed in terms of both the statistical analysis and in the practitioner’s context.},

In phase-I after listing the research questions, the data is synthesized using the observations of stakeholders in their work domain followed by semi-structured interviews. The results of the qualitative analysis, as key learning's formed the basis for grouping of SPI indicators into nine key SPI enablers. Open, focused and theoretical coding procedures in grounded theory were used to create categories, subcategories, and thematic relationships among these enablers. Further, in phase-II, the hierarchical structure model of SPI enablers is build using the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach and influencing dynamics among the enablers is analyzed using MICMAC analysis. From the results of the study, it is concluded that organization, people, and technology issues are important drivers, on which SMEs shall proactively focus for successful implementation of SPI initiatives.},

Robot-assisted surgery (RAS), a new surgical technology, can lead to new challenges in communication owing to the remote location of the surgeon away from the patient and bedside assistants. Nevertheless, few studies have studied communication strategies during RAS. In this study, 11 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies were recorded and the interaction events between the surgeon and two bedside surgical team members were categorized by modality (verbal/nonverbal), topic, and pair (sender and receiver). Both verbal and nonverbal modalities were used by all pairs. The percentage of nonverbal interactions differed significantly by pair: 66% for the Surgeon-Physician Assistant, 50% for the Physician Assistant-Scrub Nurse, and 25% for the Surgeon-Scrub Nurse, indicating different communication strategies across pairs. In addition, there was a significant dependence between topic and the percentages of verbal and nonverbal events for all pairs. Strategies to improve team communication during RAS should take into account the use of verbal and nonverbal communication means and the variation in interaction strategies based on the topic of communication.},

With one of the largest music user populations in the world, China has tremendous market potential for digital music. This study explores music use behaviours for learning and well-being among university students in China and how these findings can inform future online music service design. An investigation framework is developed based on theories in multiple related disciplines such as musicology, psychology, and sociology. In-depth interviews were conducted with forty university students in twenty universities, with an interview protocol designed based on the framework. Interview transcriptions were analysed using a thematic content analysis approach. The results reveal how students use music for multiple aspects of life corresponding to learning and major components of well-being, including physical well-being, social relationships, positive emotion, self-esteem, and meaning of life. Based on the findings we discuss emerging themes on the design of online music information systems and services. This study fills the research gap on how music is used by university students for benefiting learning and well-being. The design implications are valuable for online music services to better meet users’ evolving needs. The proposed framework and method can be readily used to study music users in various populations.},

It has not been fully explored how following others influences the actions of GitHub users. Objective: this paper studies the motivation behind following (or not following) others and the influence of popular users on their followers. Method: a mixed methods research approach was used including a survey of 800 GitHub users to uncover the reasons for following on GitHub and a complementary quantitative analysis of the activity of GitHub users to examine influence. Our quantitative analysis studied 199 popular (most followed) users and their followers. Results: we found that popular users do influence their followers by guiding them to new projects. As a user’s popularity increases, so does their rate of influence, yet the same is not true for a popular user’s rate of contribution. Conclusions: these results indicate that a new type of leadership is emerging through GitHub’s following feature and popularity can be more important than contribution in influencing others. We discuss implications of popularity and influence and their impact on social structure and leadership on OSS projects.},

This study used KakaoTaxi, a popular ODR service in Korea, to examine how customers evaluate an ODR service and determine whether customers are willing to reuse such a service. In the first-stage qualitative study, we explored decisional factors by conducting interviews with customers of the ODR service. In the second-stage quantitative study, we interpreted these previously explored decisional factors and developed a research model by applying the customer value theory. Going beyond previous research, the meta-inferences from the qualitative and quantitative studies explain how customers decide to reuse an ODR service. This study also informs ODR service providers of marketing strategies to leverage these key decisional factors in the reuse of an ODR service.},

However, whether the order of agile practice introduction as suggested in the AMMs is relevant in industry has not been evaluated in an empirical study. Objectives: In this study, we want to investigate: (1) order of agile practice introduction mentioned in AMMs, (2) order of introducing agile practices in industry, and (3) similarities and differences between (1) and (2). Methods: We conducted a literature survey to identify strategies proposed by the AMMs. We then compared the AMMs’ suggestions to the strategies used by practitioners, which we elicited from a survey and a series of interviews from an earlier study. Results: The literature survey revealed 12 AMMs which provide explicit mappings of agile practices to maturity levels. These mappings showed little agreement on when practices should be introduced. Comparison of the AMMs’ suggestions and the empirical study revealed that the guidance suggested by AMMs are not aligned with industry practice. Conclusion: Currently, AMMs do not provide sufficient information to guide agile adoption in industry. Our results suggest that there might be no universal strategy for agile adoption that works better than others.},

This is due to the fact that mobile applications are different than traditional web and desktop applications, and more and more they are moving to being used in critical domains. Mobile applications require a different approach to application quality and dependability and require an effective testing approach to build high quality and more reliable software. We performed a systematic mapping study to categorize and to structure the research evidence that has been published in the area of mobile application testing techniques and challenges that they have reported. Seventy nine (79) empirical studies are mapped to a classification schema. Several research gaps are identified and specific key testing issues for practitioners are identified: there is a need for eliciting testing requirements early during development process; the need to conduct research in real-world development environments; specific testing techniques targeting application life-cycle conformance and mobile services testing; and comparative studies for security and usability testing.},

The importance of achieving syntactic as well as semantic interoperability – as a result of transforming heterogeneous sources into Linked Data – is discussed: semantic interoperability is solved at data level in order to ease further development on top. We present a comprehensive data model for smart cities that integrates several data sources, including, geo-referenced data, public transportation, urban fault reporting, road maintenance and municipal waste collection. We show some novel ontology design patterns for modeling public transportation, urban fault reporting and road maintenance. Domain practitioners and general members of the public have been asked to play with the prototype, and fill out a survey with questions and feedbacks. A computational experiment has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of our data model in terms of practical scalability over increasing data and efficiency under complex queries.

Total twenty-two barriers were extracted from the available literature and categorized into five categories, i.e. “human resources management”, ‘coordination”, “technology”, “project management”, and “software methodology”. In the next phase, the identified barriers and their categories were further validated using the questionnaire survey. In the final phase, fuzzy-AHP method, a multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) technique, was applied to prioritize and taxonomy of identified barriers and their related categories was designed. The contribution of this study is not limited to investigate the barriers, but it also provides the roadmap to tackle the issues related to the scaling agile methods in the GSD environment.},

These aspects include the need to communicate with team mates in order to succeed, and the fluid, unpredictable nature of in-game challenges. It is suggested that while the games played an important role in skills development, interaction between students, facilitated by game play, was also a significant factor.},

Learning-performance relevance, exclusive to Course A, refers to students' perceptions of course content and activities as relevant to their performance, which in turn serve as necessary prerequisites for achieving future academic and professional goals. Temporal relevance, described primarily by students in Course B, pertains to students' non-performance-based perceptions of course content as applicable to their long-term academic and professional careers, as well as their personal intellectual growth. We posit that understanding the ways in which students perceive the relevance of course assessments, content, and activities to their near-and long-term future aspirations may allow for improved instructor support of intrinsic motivational attitudes in STEM classrooms.},

Although this practice has been mentioned positively by practitioners in informal literature and interviews, there is no systematic knowledge of its effects, prevalence, problems, and advantages. In this paper, we aim at empirically understanding whether this practice has an effect on code review effectiveness and how developers' perceive TDR. We conduct (i) a controlled experiment with 93 developers that perform more than 150 reviews, and (ii) 9 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 103 respondents to gather information on how TDR is perceived. Key results from the experiment show that developers adopting TDR find the same proportion of defects in production code, but more in test code, at the expenses of fewer maintainability issues in production code. Furthermore, we found that most developers prefer to review production code as they deem it more critical and tests should follow from it. Moreover, general poor test code quality and no tool support hinder the adoption of TDR.

  abstract     = {Background: The need for empirical investigations in software engineering is growing. Many researchers nowadays, conduct and validate their solutions using empirical research. The Survey is an empirical method which enables researchers to collect data from a large population. The main aim of the survey is to generalize the findings. Aims: In this study, we aim to identify the problems researchers face during survey design and mitigation strategies. Method: A literature review, as well as semi-structured interviews with nine software engineering researchers, were conducted to elicit their views on problems and mitigation strategies. The researchers are all focused on empirical software engineering. Results: We identified 24 problems and 65 strategies, structured according to the survey research process. The most commonly discussed problem was sampling, in particular, the ability to obtain a sufficiently large sample. To improve survey instrument design, evaluation and execution recommendations for question formulation and survey pre-testing were given. The importance of involving multiple researchers in the analysis of survey results was stressed. Conclusions: The elicited problems and strategies may serve researchers during the design of their studies. However, it was observed that some strategies were conflicting. This shows that it is important to conduct a trade-off analysis between strategies.},

  abstract     = {Much research has investigated the common reasons for build breakages. However, prior research has paid little attention to builds that may break due to reasons that are unlikely to be related to development activities. For example, Continuous Integration(CI) builds may break due to timeout or connection errors while generating the build. Such kinds of build breakages potentially introduce noises to build breakage data. Not considering such noises may lead to misleading results when studying CI builds. In this paper, we propose three criteria to identify build breakages that can potentially introduce noises to build breakage data. We apply these criteria to a dataset of 350,246 builds from153 GitHub projects that are linked with Travis CI. Our results reveal that 33% of the build breakages are due to environmental factors (e.g., errors in CI servers), 29% are due to (unfixed) errors in previous builds, and 9% are due to build jobs that were later deemed by developers as noisy (there is an overlap of 17% between these three types of breakages). We measure the impact of noises in build breakage data on modeling build breakages. We observe that models that use uncleaned build breakage data can lead to misleading associations between build breakages and development activities (e.g., the role of developer). However, such associations could not be observed after eliminating noisy build breakages. Moreover, we replicate a prior study that investigates the association between build breakages and development activities using data from 14 GitHub projects. We observe that some observations reported by the prior study (e.g., pull requests cause more breakages) do not hold after eliminating the noises from build breakage data.},

Previous studies have shown that they are highly diffused in both open- and closed-source projects, are perceived as harmful by practitioners, and can even lead to the introduction of technical debt in source code. Despite the presence of this body of research, little is known on the practitioners' perceived prominence of community smells in practice as well as on the strategies adopted to deal with them. This paper aims at bridging this gap by proposing an empirical study in which 76 software practitioners are inquired on (i) the prominence of four well-known community smells, i.e., Organizational Silo, Black Cloud, Lone Wolf, and Radio Silence, in their contexts and (ii) the methods they adopted to "refactor" them. Our results first reveal that community smells frequently manifest themselves in software projects and, more importantly, there exist specific refactoring practices to deal with each of the considered community smells.},

The study findings provide the set of critical challenges faced by the software organizations while adopting DevOps and a prioritization-based taxonomy of the DevOps challenges. The application of FAHP is novel in this research area as it assists in addressing the vagueness of practitioners concerning the influencing factors of DevOps.

However it remains unclear if users understand what protection these tools offer, and if they value that protection. In this study, we interviewed 60 participants about their experience with different communication tools and their perceptions of the tools' security properties. We found that the adoption of secure communication tools is hindered by fragmented user bases and incompatible tools. Furthermore, the vast majority of participants did not understand the essential concept of end-to-end encryption, limiting their motivation to adopt secure tools. We identified a number of incorrect mental models that underpinned participants' beliefs.},

An organization must perform a domain analysis to discover competing products, analyze their architectures and features, and ultimately discover and specify product requirements. However, delivering high quality products, depends not only on gaining an understanding of functional requirements, but also of qualities such as performance, reliability, security, and usability. Discovering such concerns early in the requirements process drives architectural design decisions. This paper extends our prior work on mining functional requirements from large collections of domain documents, by proposing and evaluating a new technique for discovering and specifying quality concerns related to specific functional components. We evaluate our approach against three domains of Positive Train Control, Electronic Health Records, and Medical Infusion Pumps, and show that it significantly outperforms a basic information retrieval approach. Finally we classified the forms of retrieved information, discussed the utility of different types, and conducted a small study with an experienced engineer to investigate the quality of requirements produced using our approach.},

In such systems, safety assurance cases (SACs) are an emerging approach that adopts a proactive strategy to produce structuralized safety justifications and arguments. While SACs are recommended in many software-intensive safety-critical domains, the lack of knowledge regarding the practitioners' perspectives on using SACs hinders effective adoption of this approach. To gain such knowledge, we interviewed nine practitioners and safety experts who focused on safety-critical software systems. In general, our participants found the SAC approach beneficial for communication of safety arguments and management of safety issues in a multidisciplinary setting. The challenges they faced when using SACs were primarily associated with (1) a lack of tool support, (2) insufficient process integration, and (3) scarcity of experienced personnel. To overcome those challenges, our participants suggested tactics that focused on creating direct safety arguments. Process and organizational adjustments are also needed to streamline SAC analysis and creation. Finally, our participants emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing about SACs across software-intensive safety-critical domains.},

  abstract     = {Background: A grand challenge for Requirement Engineering (RE) research is to help practitioners understand which RE methods work in what contexts and why. RE researchers recognize that for an RE method to be adopted in industry, RE practitioners should be able to evaluate the relevance of empirical studies to their practice. One possible approach to relevance evaluation is the set of perspective-based checklists proposed by Kitchenham et al. Specifically, the checklist from the practitioner's perspective seems to be a good candidate for evaluating the relevance of RE studies to RE practice. However, little is known about the applicability of this checklist to the RE field. Moreover, this checklist also requires a deeper analysis of its reliability. Aim: We propose a perspective-based checklist to the RE community that allows evaluating the relevance of experimental studies in RE from the practitioner's/consultant's viewpoint. Method: We followed an iterative design-science based approach in which we first analyzed the problems with a previously published checklist and then developed an operationalized proposal for a new checklist to counter these problems. We performed a reliability evaluation of this new checklist by having two practitioners apply the checklist on 24 papers that report experimental results on software requirements specifications' comprehensibility. Results: We report first-hand experiences of practitioners in evaluating the relevance of primary studies in RE, by using a perspective-based checklist. With respect to the reliability of the adjusted checklist, 9 of out 19 questions show an acceptable proportion of agreement (between two practitioners). Conclusions: Based on our experience, the contextualization and operationalization of a perspective-based checklist helps to make it more useful for the practitioners. However, to increase the reliability of the checklist, more reviewers and more discussion cycles are necessary.},

This article explores the use of machine learning algorithms and mathematical techniques for Internet-scale data mining and semantic discovery of news content that will enable researchers to mine, analyze and visualize large-scale datasets. This research has the potential to inform the integration and application of data mining to address real-world socioenvironmental issues, including water insecurity in the Southwestern United States. This paper establishes a formal definition of framing and proposes an approach for the discovery of distinct patterns that characterize prominent frames.

  abstract = {Mobile application development is rapidly evolving with prodigious economic and scientific interest. One of the major reasons for mobile application development failure is the increasing number of mobile platforms; a number of organizations endorse mobile application development prior to understanding the associated development challenges of each target platform. The objective of this paper is to identify the challenges of native, web and hybrid mobile applications, which can undermine the successful development of such applications. We have performed Systematic Literature Review (SLR) by applying customized search strings derived from our research question. We have identified challenges such as fragmentation, testing, compatibility, and performance etc. as key challenges in mobile application development. Our ultimate aim is to develop a framework in order to enable organizations to develop mobile applications (native, web or hybrid) effectively.},

In this paper, we review big data literature to analyze which requirements for the EA management discipline are proposed. Based on a systematic literature identification, conceptual categories of requirements for EA management are elicited utilizing an inductive category formation. These conceptual categories of requirements constitute a category system that facilitates a new perspective on EA management and fosters the innovation-driven evolution of the EA management discipline.},

  abstract     = {Research problem: The enhancement of communication skills among engineering students has been a focus within the engineering curriculum for many years. Despite this emphasis, continual published reports document that engineering graduates are not well versed in the areas of written and oral communication when they graduate and transition into industrial-based positions. This study focuses on examining whether game-based pedagogy could serve as a potential tool for enhancing the written and oral communication skills of engineering undergraduates. Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between communication game exposure and oral and written communication skills achievement in engineering students? (2) Do engineering students' perceptions of their oral and written communication skills development associated with participation in communication games align with their achievement in these areas? Literature review: This study examines the ability of games to enhance engineering student communication skills by using the lens of activity theory. This communication theory was chosen because it describes how the creation of a piece of communication goes beyond traditional features such as grammar and syntax to include grappling with the objective or goal of the work, the system within which the product must be completed, and the methods selected to subdivide the work. These same constraints were imposed on the students within this study, in which they were assigned a technical design report and infomercial (or elevator pitch) to assess their oral and written communication skills. Methodology: Three groups of a sophomore-level Introduction to Chemical Product Design course compared non-games, games, and games-plus instructional methods. Student design reports and infomercials were scored by two analysts using reliable and validated rubrics. Team-based performance scores for each of the three sections were compared to determine whether any resulting differences in communication achievement were associated with the incorporation of game-based activities within the classroom. Students' perceptions of their communication skill development were measured through survey instruments and focus groups. The focus group data were content-analyzed by the same two analysts using a coding scheme developed from an emergent qualitative analysis of the focus group data. Results and conclusion: We found that the use of game-based pedagogy within engineering classes can enhance oral and written communication skills even though this method of instruction is not always perceived by students as relevant to their achievement in these areas.},

The main goal of our research was to obtain evidence about whether or not such schemas can be useful to architecture students. A first prototype of the tool was evaluated with 78 students, with positive results. However, the students seemed to demand increased user participation, so they could contribute to generating better quality starting points. A second prototype was therefore implemented, allowing a higher degree of interactivity. The second prototype was evaluated with a new group of 50 students. From the two evaluations performed, it can be concluded that both versions of the tool were able to generate useful starting points (either automatically or interactively) that expedited the design process. Additionally, in the second experiment, we found that neither the nature (automatic or interactive) nor the quality of the starting point seems to have any effect on the perceived quality of the final projects.},

  abstract     = {Software Outsourcing Partnership (SOP) is a type of cooperative client-vendor relationship. SOP is an emerging strategy and is different from ordinary software development outsourcing (SDO). Usually, a fruitful outsourcing association might be converted to an outsourcing partnership. Conversely, SOP is not a risk-free business, numerous barriers associated with SOP. The overarching target of this exploratory paper is to find and analyze a list of barriers that are considered obstacles for vendors in the conversion of their surviving contractual outsourcing relationship to a partnership. Firstly, twenty-six barriers to SOP formation were identified through systematic literature review (SLR) from a sample of 106 papers and then an empirical survey was conducted with fifty experts to analyze the significance and applicability of these barriers in the SOP context. The identified barriers were further analyzed based on five variables such as decades, company size, continents, location of analysis, and perspective of the study. Ten barriers were considered as critical barriers (CBs) via SLR. Industrial experts indicate they extremely agree with five CBs. Eight CBs were equally reported on all continents. We found ten CBs common in all types of organizations. Further, twelve CBs were shared in both decades while ten CBs were found common in both academia and industry. Furthermore, four CBs were specific to clients; five were specific to vendors while ten were common to both. The association of various barriers with SOP formation is found statistically significant for twenty-five barriers with effect size (0.41 < O < 0.90, p < 0.05). Stakeholders in SOP should address all the listed barriers especially the critical ones to attain a partner position.},

  abstract     = {Code smells are poor implementation choices applied by developers during software evolution that often lead to critical flaws or failure. Much in the same way, community smells reflect the presence of organizational and socio-Technical issues within a software community that may lead to additional project costs. Recent empirical studies provide evidence that community smells are often-if not always-connected to circumstances such as code smells. In this paper we look deeper into this connection by conducting a mixed-methods empirical study of 117 releases from 9 open-source systems. The qualitative and quantitative sides of our mixed-methods study were run in parallel and assume a mutually-confirmative connotation. On the one hand, we survey 162 developers of the 9 considered systems to investigate whether developers perceive relationship between community smells and the code smells found in those projects. On the other hand, we perform a fine-grained analysis into the 117 releases of our dataset to measure the extent to which community smells impact code smell intensity (i.e., criticality). We then propose a code smell intensity prediction model that relies on both technical and community-related aspects. The results of both sides of our mixed-methods study lead to one conclusion: community-related factors contribute to the intensity of code smells. This conclusion supports the joint use of community and code smells detection as a mechanism for the joint management of technical and social problems around software development communities.},

Because of the complexity of natural language , however, automatically synthesized documents often fall short on quality and completeness compared to those authored by human experts. We develop a complementary "human-as-sensors" approach to document integration that generates API FAQs based on users' help-seeking behavior and history. We investigated the benefits and limitations of this approach in the context of programming education. This paper describes a prototype system called COFAQ and a controlled experiment with 18 novice programmers. The study confirms that the generated FAQs effectively fosters knowledge transfer between the programmers and significantly reduce the need for repeated search. It also discovers several difficulties novice programmers encountered when seeking API help as well as the strategies they used to seek and utilize API knowledge.},

However, there is considerable less research on how to effectively deliver software development skills in a way that can be accepted and ultimately adopted by this user group. As a way to bridge this gap, we ran an extracurricular project-based workshop, targeting 10-12 years old learners with no prior coding experience, delivered over five days in the computer labs at the University of Chile. In this workshop, participants follow hands-on activities where they acquire the basics of computer programming and develop a small-scale software application using Scratch. These activities showcase that good software engineering practices can be taught to K-6 students, where these students are guided by experienced computer science undergraduate and graduate students. This paper presents a descriptive case study that focuses on assessing how K-6 learners assimilate and use these practices when developing their first computing application in a non-traditional learning experience. In order to do this, we designed and calibrated a rubric to evaluate the software products generated by the workshop participants. Our findings provide further evidence that it is indeed possible to teach initial notions of software engineering to this user group, structuring these constructs in a non-technical language that can be assimilated by novice developers. Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in this matter according to gender and socio-economic status.},

To achieve this, we have conducted a systematic mapping study and questionnaire survey to identify and validate the barriers of the RE process with industry practitioners. A total of 20 barriers were identified and validated with the experts. Moreover, we have performed organization types (client and vendor), organization size (small, medium, and large) and experts' levels (junior, intermediate, and senior) based analysis to provide a clear understanding of the RE barriers in the three different context. Besides, we have also developed a theoretical framework by mapping the investigated barriers into six core knowledge areas of software process improvement. The mapping results indicated that project administration is the most significant knowledge area of investigated barriers. We believe that the findings of this study will provide a framework that assists the GSD practitioners in developing an effective plan and strategies to improve the RE process in the GSD context.},
